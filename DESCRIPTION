Description: Manage optional data for your package. The data can be hosted anywhere, and you have to give a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for each file. File integrity checks are supported. This is useful for package authors who need to ship more than the 5 Megabyte of data currently allowed by the the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
